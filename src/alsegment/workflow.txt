Active Learning workflow:
1. Initialize ActiveLearner class with initial information (budget k, list of available train files, etc.)
2. Initial training dataset created (e.g. random sample from train files) = D_train
3. Run trainer on D_train for number of epochs/certain accuracy level reached/early stopping
4. Use acquisition function on D_pool and select best k points
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for given number of times
6. Report improvement in model results over validation dataset
